# Specification for Project 6 EDA Notebook

## Overview

Project 6 is an opportunity to create your own custom
exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using
GitHub, Git, Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and other popular data analytics tools.

## Deliverable Names

- GitHub Repository:  **datafun-06-eda**
- Documentation:      README.md
- Notebook:           **yourname_eda.ipynb**

## Start a New Notebook Project

Copy from one of your existing notebook respositories to get started. 
There are typically too many files to start from scratch - just fork your own repo into a new GitHub repo with the project 6 repo name. 

## External Dependencies

This project will generally use the same project dependencies as we used in our prior EDA. 

## Objective

Perform and publish a custom EDA project to demonstrate skills with popular tools for data analytics.
The notebook should tell a data story and visually present findings
in a clear and engaging manner.

## Explore Datasets

Choose a dataset for analysis.
You will want a known, clean dataset. 
Cleaning data can run 60-80% of the project (or more) - you don't need to
demonstrate cleaning skills for this project.  
The recommended approach is to select one of the other pre-installed datasets in Seaborn.
You can view a list of the Seaborn datasets in the first link below. 
The additional links offer a range of options.

- [List of Seaborn Datasets Installed](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

You may use your own data if you have permission and there is no confidential information included. 
Be careful with your data selection and ensure you have rights to use the content.

## Requirements

### 1. Create and Manage Project Virtual Environment

This project uses external packages, which are not included in the Python Standard Library - we must install them. 
To keep our project separate from all other Python projects,
we will create and manage a local project virtual environment and install our packages into the local project virtual environment.

- NEWER: [pro-analytics-02](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/) uses `uv` and `pyproject.toml` for dependencies (RECOMMENDED).
  OLDER: pro-analytics-01 used `pip` and `venv` and `requirements.txt` for dependencies

Both approaches work. 
You can almost always use whichever approach you like best - the project results should be exactly the same. 

### 2. Start a new EDA Notebook

Document the process and commands you use in your README.md.

Copy/paste and edit a new notebook to hold your custom analysis.


### 3.  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform a unique exploratory data analysis project using the tools and skills covered previously. 

Present your notebook with an opening that introduces yourself and your topic.
Use Markdown section headings to introduce each step.
Interpret the visualizations and statistics to narrate a clear and compelling data story.
Present your findings in a logical and engaging manner.

## Notebook Execution

Run your notebook entirely to ensure it executes without errors. 
This includes checking all code cells and ensuring all data visualizations render as expected.
Confirm that your notebook renders correctly on GitHub after pushing, as this ensures your work is viewable by others.

## Evaluation Criteria

- The project should be functional and meet all requirements.
- The project should be well-written and well-documented.
- The project should be presented in a clear and organized manner.
- The project should be submitted on-time and reflect an original, creative effort.

See rubric for additional information.
